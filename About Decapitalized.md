# About **`Decapitalized`**
This branch contains a version of **`pokeemerald-expansion`** that is 99+% decapitalized. This includes graphics, too. Just merge it into your project and be amazed at how nice it is to not have words like POKéMON and BRENDAN and GYM pop out all the time. This has been a pet peeve of mine since I first played the early-gen games, way back in like 2000. Thank goodness they don't still do that.

# What isn't decapped?
- There are a few lines of text here and there that are clearly labels and thus aren't decapped, like some of the Slateport Museum text. Generally if it's fully capped between quotes “LIKE THIS,” I haven't touched it.
- The Slot Machine backlights.
- The menu labels on the Pokémon Stat Screen. They're too short for me to legibly decap them. I may look into doing this later, but for now, anything that is shorter than 5 pixels has been mostly left alone.
- The Easy Chat system has been left as-is, on the grounds that it looks weird if you decap it. You either End Up with Inconsistent capitalization, Or You Look Like You're Doing A \[Redacted\] Impression.

# Other Changes
- This branch also includes a few grammar fixes and some syntax fixes in the Debug files that were really, heh, bugging me.
- I also left in capitalized versions of all the graphics if you don't want those changed. They're all cleverly labeled like so: **`contest_tough_CAPS.png`**.
- I also decapped a few stray things in the HGSS Pokédex. Presumably, if you're using this, you want as many things to be decapped as possible. If you don't, just don't use any of the HGSS Pokédex files.

Modify any of it in any way you want. If you want to credit me, you're welcome to, but I'd rather you donate to an LGBT charity if you can afford it.
